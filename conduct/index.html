<h1>Donut.js Code of Conduct</h1>

<p><em>Last updated: July 20, 2017</em></p>

<p>Everyone participating in the Donut.js community&mdash;including but not limited to the Donut.js monthly meetings, Donut.js yearly barbecue, and #donut_js Slack channel&mdash;is required to agree to the following code of conduct. This includes all event attendees, speakers, performers, patrons, organizers, and volunteers.</p>

<p>Donut.js will enforce this code at all times. We expect cooperation from everyone to ensure a safe, diverse, and welcoming environment.</p>

<h2>The Condensed Version</h2>

<p>Donut.js is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. </p>

<p>Sexist, racist, discriminatory, or harassing language and imagery is not appropriate in the Donut.js community, in person or online. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the Donut.js monthly events, the Donut.js organizing team, the #donut_js Slack channel, and all future events without a refund at the discretion of Donut.js organizers.</p>

<h2>The Less Condensed Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Exception: Discussion or images related to sex, pornography, discriminatory language, or similar is welcome if it meets all of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists</li>
<li>It is presented in a respectful manner</li>
<li>Attendees are respectfully given ample warning and opportunity to leave beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<p>This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual images as attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are required to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, Donut.js may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling the offender with no refund.</p>

<h2>Reporting and Enforcement</h2>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Matthew McVickar or another Donut.js organizer immediately. If you can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t wish to speak in person, or prefer to talk privately or electronically, contact us at hello@donutjs.club or by direct message in the #donut_js Slack channel.</p>

<p>All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

We are a donut-themed web programming meetup in Portland inspired by <a href="http://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a> and <a href="http://brooklynjs.com/">BrooklynJS</a>

This repo is mainly for our website, but is also used to help plan events and store information.

We also chat and organize in the [#donut_js channel on the BoroJS Slack](http://slack.borojs.com/).
